Each OS patch or update results in a new unique image ID. If this data source is used to populate fields like `boot_volume.source_id` in a server resource, it may cause Terraform to detect changes and recreate the associated resource.\n\nTo avoid unintended updates or resource replacements:\n - Prefer using a static `image_id` to pin a specific image version.\n - If you accept automatic image updates but wish to suppress resource changes, use a `lifecycle` block to ignore relevant changes. For example:\n\n```hcl\nresource \"stackit_server\" \"example\" {\n  boot_volume = {\n    size        = 64\n    source_type = \"image\"\n    source_id   = data.stackit_image.latest.id\n  }\n\n  lifecycle {\n    ignore_changes = [boot_volume[0].source_id]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can also list available images using the [STACKIT CLI](https://github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-cli):\n\n```bash\nstackit image list\n```\n\n~\u003e This datasource is in beta and may be subject to breaking changes in the future.
