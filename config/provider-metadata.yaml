            credentials_ref: (String) Credentials reference for logs. Not changeable after creation.
            disable_security_group_assignment: (Boolean) If set to true, this will disable the automatic assignment of a security group to the load balancer's targets. This option is primarily used to allow targets that are not within the load balancer's own network or SNA (STACKIT network area). When this is enabled, you are fully responsible for ensuring network connectivity to the targets, including managing all routing and security group rules manually. This setting cannot be changed after the load balancer is created.
            display_name: (String)
            external_address: (String) External Load Balancer IP address where this Load Balancer is exposed.
            healthy_threshold: (Number) Healthy threshold of the health checking.
            id: (String) Terraform's internal resource ID. It is structured as "project_id","region","name".
            idle_timeout: '(String) Time after which an idle connection is closed. The default value is set to 300 seconds, and the maximum value is 3600 seconds. The format is a duration and the unit must be seconds. Example: 30s'
            interval: (String) Interval duration of health checking in seconds.
            interval_jitter: (String) Interval duration threshold of the health checking in seconds.
            ip: (String) Target IP
            listeners: (Attributes List) List of all listeners which will accept traffic. Limited to 20. (see below for nested schema)
            logs: (Attributes) Observability logs configuration. Not changeable after creation. (see below for nested schema)
            metrics: (Attributes) Observability metrics configuration. Not changeable after creation. (see below for nested schema)

            networks: (Attributes List) List of networks that listeners and targets reside in. (see below for nested schema)
            observability: (Attributes) We offer Load Balancer metrics observability via ARGUS or external solutions. Not changeable after creation. (see below for nested schema)
            options: (Attributes) Defines any optional functionality you want to have enabled on your load balancer. (see below for nested schema)
            plan_id: '(String) The service plan ID. If not defined, the default service plan is p10. Possible values are: p10, p50, p250, p750.'
            port: (Number) Port number where we listen for traffic.
            private_address: (String) Transient private Load Balancer IP address. It can change any time.
            private_network_only: (Boolean) If true, Load Balancer is accessible only via a private network IP address.
            project_id: (String) STACKIT project ID to which the Load Balancer is associated.
            protocol: '(String) Protocol is the highest network protocol we understand to load balance. Possible values are: PROTOCOL_UNSPECIFIED, PROTOCOL_TCP, PROTOCOL_UDP, PROTOCOL_TCP_PROXY, PROTOCOL_TLS_PASSTHROUGH.'
            push_url: (String) Credentials reference for logs. Not changeable after creation.
            region: (String) The resource region. If not defined, the provider region is used.
            role: '(String) The role defines how the load balancer is using the network. Possible values are: ROLE_UNSPECIFIED, ROLE_LISTENERS_AND_TARGETS, ROLE_LISTENERS, ROLE_TARGETS.'
            security_group_id: (String) The ID of the egress security group assigned to the Load Balancer's internal machines. This ID is essential for allowing traffic from the Load Balancer to targets in different networks or STACKIT network areas (SNA). To enable this, create a security group rule for your target VMs and set the remote_security_group_id of that rule to this value. This is typically used when disable_security_group_assignment is set to true.
            server_name_indicators: (Attributes List) A list of domain names to match in order to pass TLS traffic to the target pool in the current listener (see below for nested schema)
            session_persistence: (Attributes) Here you can setup various session persistence options, so far only "use_source_ip_address" is supported. (see below for nested schema)
            target_pool: (String) Reference target pool by target pool name.
            target_pools: (Attributes List) List of all target pools which will be used in the Load Balancer. Limited to 20. (see below for nested schema)
            target_port: (Number) Identical port number where each target listens for traffic.
            targets: (Attributes List) List of all targets which will be used in the pool. Limited to 1000. (see below for nested schema)
            tcp: (Attributes) Options that are specific to the TCP protocol. (see below for nested schema)
            timeout: (String) Active health checking timeout duration in seconds.
            udp: (Attributes) Options that are specific to the UDP protocol. (see below for nested schema)
            unhealthy_threshold: (Number) Unhealthy threshold of the health checking.
            use_source_ip_address: (Boolean) If true then all connections from one source IP address are redirected to the same target. This setting changes the load balancing algorithm to Maglev.
